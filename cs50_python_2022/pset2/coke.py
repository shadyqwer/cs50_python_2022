# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents
# and only accepts coins in these denominations: 25 cents, 10 cents,
# and 5 cents.
# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to
# insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount
# due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents
# in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers,
# and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

            print('Amount due: {}'.format(price))
