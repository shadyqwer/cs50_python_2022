# cs50_python_2022
This repository contains code and exercises that I completed during the CS50 Introduction to Python 2022 course.
### What I learned
During the course, I expanded my knowledge on the following:
- Writing unit tests using the pytest module
- Regular expressions (re module)
- List and dictionary comprehension
- Various Python libraries (e.g., os, random, datetime, csv, json, requests)

I found the course to be an excellent introduction to Python, and I am now more confident in my Python skills.
